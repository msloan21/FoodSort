## Getting Started
There are two ways to run this application.  The first uses Spring Boot's Command Line Runner and can be ran by opening a Java IDE and running com.mgmtp.foodsort.ConsoleApplication

The other way is as a RESTful web service, in memory database and a simple React front end.  To start the service, open a Java IDE
and run com.mgmtp.foodsort.WebApplication.  Please do not change the default port configuration of 8080.

Next open a command prompt and cd to:
